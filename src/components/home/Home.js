                    At ThemeGrill Pvt. Ltd in Nepal, I am currently working as
                    Senior PHP Developer and WordPress Plugin Developer (Team
                    Lead) on two WordPress Plugins, User Registration and
                    Everest Forms. I am solely responsible for all decisions
                    relating to both plugins.

                  <Text mt={5} lineHeight={2}>
                    I was employed as a Laravel developer at infomax Pvt. Ltd.
                    prior to joining ThemeGrill. It was more of a teaching
                    position during my tenure there because I worked on projects
                    that were never released to the public and also had the
                    responsibility of training new employees.

                  <Text mt={5} lineHeight={2}>
                    Prior to that, I was working as a freelancer and using
                    Laravel to create web APIs for mobile applications. The
                    majority of the ventures failed to reach the market; those
                    that did could not maintain their level of success.
                  </Text>
                  <Text mt={5} lineHeight={2}>
                    I would classify myself as more of a backend developer, with
                    a primary focus on PHP, while I am equally comfortable with
                    frontend development technologies.
                  </Text>
                  <Text mt={5} lineHeight={2}>
                    Aside from technical matters, I enjoy watching movies,
                    television shows, and animes whenever I have time. So that's
                    all there is to know about me.
